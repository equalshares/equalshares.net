# advice project proposers

Minimum number of votes for a project to be eligible to win

Under the Method of Equal Shares, costlier projects need a higher number of votes to have a chance at winning. In this example, we consider a city with a budget of €100 000, and ask for projects of different cost, what percentage of votes they need to gather at minimum to be theoretically able to win.
