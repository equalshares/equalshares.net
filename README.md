This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator.

To develop, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), for example using `brew install node` on macOS.

For local development, go to the website directory and run:

```
npm run start
```

This will start a local development server. The website can then be viewed at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes to the source files are immediately reflected in the browser.

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory. This can then be served using any static contents hosting service.
