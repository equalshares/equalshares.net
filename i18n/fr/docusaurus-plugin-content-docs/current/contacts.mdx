# Contacts

The Method of Equal Shares has been developed by computer science and economics researchers at several universities around the world. Feel free to contact them:

* They would be excited to hear from anyone who is considering implementing the Method of Equal Shares in a participatory budgeting setting, and to advise, assist, and support those efforts. 
* They are also happy to answer questions about the method and about voting in participatory budgeting more broadly, from journalists, researchers, advocacy organizations, or interested members of the public.

## Main contact

The Method of Equal Shares was initially proposed by:
* [Dominik Peters](https://dominik-peters.de) (CNRS, UniversitÃ© Paris Dauphine) and 
* [Piotr Skowron](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~ps219737/) (University of Warsaw) 

Feel free to contact either of us with any technical questions, feedback about this website, or advice for implementations. We are also happy to connect you with local researchers who are working on the Method of Equal Shares.
