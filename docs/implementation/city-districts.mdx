# How to deal with city districts?

## Pre-dividing the budget among districts

* Advantage: a guaranteed amount of the budget is spent in each district
* Disadvantage: voters cannot vote for projects outside their own district

## Running a single city-wide election

* Advantage: the voting rule can optimally divide the budget between districts
* Advantage: the voting rule can optimally decide how much to spend on city-wide projects
* Advantage: voters can vote for projects outside their own district
* Disadvantage: some districts may see little spending if its voters prefer city-wide projects or projects in other districts
* Disadvantage: more projects available may be harder for voters to comprehend
