# How to break ties?

## Summary

In rare cases, two or more projects may be tied (for example because they have exactly the same cost and received exactly the same number of votes).
Implementations of the Method of Equal Shares are designed so as to minimize the likelihood of ties.
However, if a tie still occurs, it may need to be broken by election officials by lot, i.e. by using randomness.

:::tip

An easy way of definitely avoiding ties is to ensure that no two projects have the same cost (even if costs only differ by <CurrencySymbol/>1). Then a tie will never occur if the tie-breaking procedure below is followed.

## Recommended tie-breaking procedure

In the execution of the Method of Equal Shares, a tie can occur when two or more projects have the same effective vote count.
In isolation, ties are unlikely to occur in large elections (such as those on the city scale).
But the Method of Equal Shares is usually run several times in a row to determine the best amount of money that the voters get assigned at the start of the method. 
(See [Completions](completion) for details.)
This makes it more likely that a tie is encountered, and the tie will need to be broken.

We recommend that when there is a tie between two or more projects, because they have the same effective voting count at some step of the method,
the tie should be broken by the following procedure:
* The project with the lowest cost is selected.
* If two or more of the tied projects have the same lowest cost, then the (lowest-cost) project with the highest initial vote count is selected (that is, the raw vote count of the project before the vote count got reduced in the course of running the Method of Equal Shares).
* If two or more projects have the lowest cost and the same initial vote count, then the tie is broken by lot, i.e. uniformly at random.

As a procedural matter, there are two ways to proceed with regard to the potential use of randomness:
1. Before computing the election outcome, election officials check whether there are any collections of projects that have the same cost and the same initial vote count. For each such collection of potentially tied projects, they determine a tie-breaking order, for example by drawing names from a hat.
2. Alternatively, compute the election outcome using an implementation of the Method of Equal Shares that ends with an error message if a tie is encountered. Only in this (unlikely) event, proceed like in Option 1.

:::info Technical info

In the unlikely event that randomness must be used, we recommend that
election officials proceed like in Option 2 described above:
randomly draw a tie-breaking order, and then run the Method of Equal Shares (including the completion) using that tie-breaking order.
While using the completion, it is not a good idea to break ties differently for different values of the initial budget.

## Examples

### Example 1
As an example, suppose that the Method of Equal Shares ends up in the following situation, where three projects remain available for selection:

| Project | Cost | Initial vote count | Effective vote count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project 1 | <CurrencySymbol/>600 | 500 | **200** |
| Project 2 | <CurrencySymbol/>700 | 300 | **200** |
| Project 3 | <CurrencySymbol/>100 | 150 | 100 |

Projects 1 and 2 have the highest effective vote count, so one of them should be selected. 
Since they have the same effective vote count, we need to break the tie.
Thus, the method selects **Project 1**, because its cost of <CurrencySymbol/>600 is lower than the cost of Project 2, which is <CurrencySymbol/>700.

### Example 2

Here is a similar example.

| Project | Cost | Initial vote count | Effective vote count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project 1 | <CurrencySymbol/>600 | 500 | **200** |
| Project 2 | <CurrencySymbol/>600 | 300 | **200** |
| Project 3 | <CurrencySymbol/>600 | 150 | **200** |

This time, all three projects have the same effective vote count, so again we need to break the tie.
All three projects have the same cost, so we need to break the tie by looking at the initial vote count.
Thus, the method selects **Project 1**, because its initial vote count of 500 is higher than the initial vote count of both Project 2 and of Project 3.

### Example 3

Here is a final example.

| Project | Cost | Initial vote count | Effective vote count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project 1 | <CurrencySymbol/>600 | 500 | **200** |
| Project 2 | <CurrencySymbol/>600 | 500 | **200** |

Projects 1 and 2 have the same effective vote count, so we need to break the tie.
But they both have the same cost and the same initial vote count.
Thus, the tie needs to be broken by lot, for example by having the election official flip a coin.
