# How to compute the results?

<!-- Todo: talk about using floats or fractions. -->

## The `pabutools` package

The [`pabutools`](https://github.com/pbvoting/pabutools) package is a free and open-source Python package that contains implementations of several voting rules for participatory budgeting, including the Method of Equal Shares.
It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pbvoting/pabutools).
The package can be installed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pabutools/) using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pabutools
```

## Code snippets

Here, we provide short code snippets for computing the results of the Method of Equal Shares in several programming languages.

<details>
<summary>General trick to speed up the computation</summary>
<div>
<p>
During the computation, the algorithm needs to repeatedly compute the "<a href="../explanation">effective vote count</a>" of each project,
which is an expensive step. This part can be sped up by only recalculating the effective vote count
if it matters. 
</p>
<p>
The main observation is that the effective vote count <em>can only decrease</em> as the algorithm proceeds.
What we do in the implementation is the following:
we start with the project which had the highest effective vote count in the previous round.
We re-calculate the effective vote count of this project.
Then we compare its new effective vote count with the effective vote count of the project
with the second-highest effective vote count in the previous round.
If the new effective vote count is higher than the effective vote count of the second-highest project,
then we know that we have found the project with the highest effective vote count in the current round
(because all the other projects previously had a lower effective vote count, which in the mean
time could only have decreased even further).
Thus, we can immediately select it.
</p>
<p>
This optimization is used in all the code snippets on this page.
