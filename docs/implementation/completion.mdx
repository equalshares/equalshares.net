# Completion of the Method of Equal Shares

In the [explanation](../explanation) of the Method of Equal Shares, Step 1 says:

> The overall budget is divided equally among the voters.

For example, if the overall budget is <CurrencySymbol/>100 000, and there are 1000 voters, then each voter would be allocated a share of <CurrencySymbol/>100.
However, when we compute the Method of Equal Shares with this initial division of the budget, we will typically find that the election outcome does not use up the entire budget.
This is because for some of the voters, the method cannot productively use the budget share assigned to them.
For example, if a voter only votes for 1 project, and this project does not receive enough votes to win, then the method cannot spend the <CurrencySymbol/>100 assigned to this voter.

In simulations using voting data from Warsaw, the Method of Equal Shares spends approximately 60-70% of the available budget.
Of course, election officials would usually prefer to spend close to 100% of the budget.
Therefore, the Method of Equal Shares needs to be **completed**, which means that its outcome needs to be modified so that almost the entire budget is used.

## Recommended completion method

The basic idea is to give voters a larger initial budget share. 
In the example, instead of giving each voter <CurrencySymbol/>100, we could give them <CurrencySymbol/>130.
More precisely, we go through each possible value <CurrencySymbol/>100, <CurrencySymbol/>101, <CurrencySymbol/>102, and so on.
For each value, we compute the outcome of the Method of Equal Shares.
We stop in one of two cases:
* The outcome is _exhaustive_, which means that the budget limit would be exceeded if we added any additional project to the outcome.
* If we were to run the Method of Equal Shares with the next higher value, then the resulting outcome would exceed the budget limit.
