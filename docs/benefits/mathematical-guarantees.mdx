# Mathematical fairness guarantees

The Method of Equal Shares was proposed and developed by mathematicians and computer scientists who proved
mathematical theorems that say that the method guarantees fairness to voters in certain precise senses.
On this page, we will describe some of their results, both on an intuitive level and in more technical terms.

## A project is guaranteed to be funded provided it gets a number of "bullet" votes that is proportionate to its cost {#bullet-votes}

The first mathematical guarantee concerns individual projects: they are sure to be funded provided they get at least a certain minimum number of unique votes.

For a precise example, consider a project proposal with a cost that would consume 5% of the overall available budget. 
Then, if at least 5% of voters vote for that project _and for no other projects_, then this proposal will win under the Method of Equal Shares.

> **Theorem**. Let $P$ be a project and let $\text{cost}(P)$ be the cost of the proposal. Suppose $B$ is the overall budget, and $n$ is the total number of voters. If at least $n \cdot \text{cost}(P)/B$ voters vote for $P$ and no other projects, then $P$ will be among the projects selected by the Method of Equal Shares.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Each of the voters who voted only for $P$ gets assigned a budget share of at least $B/n$ at the start of the computation of the method. (It could be more than $B/n$ because we [complete](../implementation/completion) the method.)

Therefore, the total amount of budget assigned to voters who vote only for $P$ is at least
$$
\underbrace{n \cdot \frac{\text{cost}(P)}{B}}_{\text{number of voters}} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{B}{n}}_{\text{budget share}} = \text{cost}(P).
$$

By definition of the Method of Equal Shares, it finishes only when no more projects can be afforded by their supporters. But that means that $P$ must be among the selected projects, because the voters who only vote for $P$ retain all their money until $P$ is selected, and thus $P$ is always affordable.
</details>

Using the standard voting method for participatory budgeting (which just selects the most popular projects until the budget runs out), no similar guarantee holds. Even a very cost-effective project (for example, costing 1% of the budget) may need a large number of voters (for example, more than 30%) to win under the standard method.

## Groups with similar votes will be represented in the outcome


## Other basic voting criteria

There are other basic voting criteria that are not "fairness guarantees" in the senses above, but are still worth mentioning. The following criteria are satisfied by the Method of Equal Shares:

* <SemiBold>Polynomial time computability</SemiBold>: The outcome of the Method of Equal Shares can be computed in polynomial time by a simple algorithm. Thus the winning projects can be determined quickly, usually in less than a minute even for elections in large cities.
* <SemiBold>Unanimity</SemiBold>: If a project is supported by all voters, then it wins (assuming an approval election).
* <SemiBold>Independence of clones</SemiBold>: By "cloning" a project, we mean proposing one or more identical copies of a project already on the ballot. We assume that each voter either supports all or none of the clones. Under the Method of Equal Shares, the following holds: if a losing project is cloned, none of the clones win; and if a winning project is cloned, then at least one of the clones wins.
* <SemiBold>Monotonicity</SemiBold>: If a project wins, and a voter changes their ballot by adding an approval to the winning project, then that project continues to win.
* <SemiBold>Discount monotonicity</SemiBold>: If a project wins, and its cost is reduced, then it stays winning. If a project loses, and its price is increased, then it stays losing.
* <SemiBold>Independence to empty ballots</SemiBold>: If we add a voter to the election who approves none of the projects, then the outcome does not change (assuming we complete the method in the usual way).

Several other criteria are failed, however, including:
<ul style={{ listStyleType: '"\\2717  "' }}>
<li>Pareto-optimality</li>
<li>Budget limit monotonicity (a winning project should stay winning if the available budget is increased)</li>
<li>Strategyproofness (a voter should not be able to improve the outcome by changing their ballot)</li>
</ul>
