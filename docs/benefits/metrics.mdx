# Higher and more equal voter satisfaction

When simulating the election outcomes in the participatory budgeting elections of several major cities, we found that voter satisfaction would increase when switching to the Method of Equal Shares. More importantly, we find that the satisfaction is more equally distributed among the voters, and the least satisfied voters see significantly more spending on their preferred projects under the Method of Equal Shares.
